## Challenges

During the development of this project, we encountered several challenges:

- **Finding the Correct API:** One of the major challenges was finding an API that provided the necessary data for stock prices, sector performance, and top market companies. We needed an API that could meet our requirements and was reliable.

- **API Rate Limits:** We had to ensure the chosen API allowed a sufficient number of requests per day. We selected an API that provided up to 25 API requests per day, which required efficient handling and caching of data to avoid exceeding the limit.
